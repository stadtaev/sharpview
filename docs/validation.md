# Research increment validation

The initial increment uses the existing production projects and a shared xUnit test project. Validation combines extracted fixture facts, independently assembled Core snapshots, in-memory semantic compilations, and fresh CLI processes.

Reproduce with `dotnet build tests/Fixtures/ResearchSolution/ResearchSolution.slnx`, `dotnet build sharpview.slnx --no-incremental`, and `dotnet test sharpview.slnx`. Reports are in `docs/samples`.

The self-analysis smoke check (on the frozen pre-refactor source) loaded SharpView's four projects and exported 953 callable facts, 2,870 call sites, 32 throw sites, four catches, 22 implementation candidates and 93 explicitly recorded gaps; before the lambda/local-function identity fix it reported 834 callables and 2,649 call sites because same-shaped lambda bodies collapsed into one fact. This checks loading/extraction on the host's own code; it does not replace an external Web API experiment.

## Regression comparison (consumer model increment)

Every task of the consumer-model plan was compared against a frozen baseline (the pre-refactor commit, built separately): 13 CLI runs covering `controllers`, `exceptions`, `chains` (declared and direct), `methods`, `inspect` (text and JSON) on the fixture, and `inspect`/`chains`/`methods`/JSON on a frozen copy of SharpView's own source. Final result: every fixture text report is byte-identical to the baseline. Intended differences only: JSON schema 3 (string IDs, new facts, `controllerActions` computed instead of stored); self-analysis counts grew because overridden members are registered (+8 callables), lambda/local bodies are no longer collapsed (+103 bodies) and field/property dependencies were added. Old-vs-new runs with a `namespace:<TypeName>` mapping equal new runs with `type:<TypeName>`.

## External Web API attempt (2026-10-17)

Input: the locally supplied `api-osa.zip`, extracted into a temporary directory outside this repository, excluding
Git metadata and existing build outputs. The archive and its source files were not modified. No external source or
package-feed credentials are included in this repository.

Source inventory (not SharpView analysis results): 13 source projects, 355 C# source files, and 12 files named
`*Controller.cs`, including a base controller. This is a useful validation target for cross-project call relationships
and interface boundaries.

Attempted prerequisite:

```sh
dotnet restore src/dunnhumby.Osa.Api/dunnhumby.Osa.Api.csproj --disable-parallel
```

The configured Artifactory source returned `NU1301` / HTTP 404 for package lookups. The restore was bounded to 50 seconds.
The API also references private packages, so replacing the feed with nuget.org would not establish a faithful build.
No semantic analysis accuracy, coverage percentages, or performance conclusions can be claimed from this attempt.

To finish: supply a working package-source configuration or a restored checkout, run `inspect --json`, `reach`
(both with and without `--follow-candidates`), `projects`, and the four `exceptions` views on the API project. Record extraction gaps,
dispatch/missing-body boundaries, limit flags, and exception reason counts. Check representative controller-to-service
paths and exception witnesses against source before judging the reports useful. Keep raw reports outside the repository
unless the application's source identifiers are intended for publication.
